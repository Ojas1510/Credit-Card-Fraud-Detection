# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. This project aims to develop a simple fraud detection model using logistic regression. We'll use a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about various credit card transactions, including labels for whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

# Setup
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt or conda install -r- requirements.txt

# Data Preparation
Download the credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
The dataset is expected to have the following columns: [list down the column names].
