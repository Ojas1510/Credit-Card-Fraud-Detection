# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. This project aims to develop a simple fraud detection model using logistic regression. We'll use a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about various credit card transactions, including labels for whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

# Requirements
Python 3.x <br />
Pandas <br />
NumPy <br />
Scikit-learn <br />


# Setup
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt or conda install -r- requirements.txt

# Data Preparation
Download the credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. <br />
The dataset is expected to have the following columns: <br />
Collum_1 is time of the day <br />
Collum_2 to Collum_28 are the credit card details which are converted in numerical values using PCA <br />
Collum_29 is Amount <br />
Collum_30 is label, [0,1] <br />
# Data Analysis
1.Missing Values Analysis <br />
Performing a missing values analysis is crucial to ensure the dataset's completeness and identify any potential data imbalances. <br />
Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. <br />
Check for missing values in each column and handle them appropriately, such as removing or imputing missing data. <br />
2.Statistical Measures <br />
Analyzing statistical measures helps us gain insights into the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions, which can aid in understanding the data better. <br />
Calculate and compare the mean values for the amount of legitimate transactions and fraudulent transactions. <br />
Compute other relevant statistical measures such as median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for both types of transactions. <br />
The statistical analysis will provide a better understanding of the data distribution and assist in making informed decisions during model building and evaluation. <br />
